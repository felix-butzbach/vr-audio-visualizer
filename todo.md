Prepare code for different visualizations.
Add the controls (at least start/stop music)
Improve visualisation (recover the inital versions)
Try to deploy via bolt, once new tokes are available (tomorrow).
Figure out, how to access the microphone or audio of the Quest.
Why is this stackblitz not appearing in my collections.
Give feedback for bolt.new (Lost track of last changes, could not restore previous version of the code. Added '...unchanged code' comments instead of the actual code some times...)
